The sacred serpent spirit of worship among voodooists, Li Grand Zombi is considered not a menace, but a loa of peace â€“ with purity and optimism emanating from its presence. Recognized as the keeperÂ of intuitive knowledge, the snake knows that which can not be spoken. With that in mind, we offered up this elixir (read: dark rum) to our clients as a symbol of the peace, happiness and wisdom we wished them in the coming year.
