Designed to carry her through a myriad of daily activities and situations, each bag is a shape-shifter â€”Â a few tucks and pulls, and a backpack becomes an on-trend satchel purse. </strong>

The brand was designed to echoÂ the company'sÂ function-meets-fashion approach that would reflect itsÂ feminine edge with an elegant twist. The logotype needed to endure stamped in the leatherÂ interior and was developed around custom, confidentÂ and unfussy typography. TheÂ accompanying mark that unites the V's was ultimately translated into the product hardware such as the zipper pulls. The result is a chic, no-nonsense brand identity, with a versatility well-suited to the products it represents.
