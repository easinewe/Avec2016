As long-term partners with this exclusive brand, Gilt asked us to not only help improve the mobile shopping experience, but also elevate the look and feel of the mobile experience across platforms. Every screen was redesigned and coupled with considered user experience choices, driving a more streamlined and flat shopping experience.
