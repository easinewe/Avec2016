Dr. Mehmet Oz and Dr. Michael Roizen founded YouBeauty in 2011, working together with a team of beauty and health experts. The site lives at the intersection of beauty and science, delivering daily content that gives users a holistic view of their well-being, along with tips on how to "become your most beautiful you." We took a fresh, modern approach to the rebranding and site design, communicating the brand values and showcasing the editorial. The design is streamlined and simple, just like the content itself.";s:10:"post_title";s:9:"YouBeauty";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:10:"you-beauty";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-07-07 20:10:36";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-07-07 20:10:36";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:49:"http://dev.avec.us/?post_type=project&#038;p=1140";s:10:"menu_order";i:13;s:9:"post_type";s:7:"project";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
