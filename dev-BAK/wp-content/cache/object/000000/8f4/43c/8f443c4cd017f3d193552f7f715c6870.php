We collaborated closely with the project developers to bring the brand and visual strategy to life. While gathering backgroundÂ information, we were told by a member of the projectÂ team that the building contained not a single straight line â€” a fact we considered remarkable until a separate team member informed us that the building contained no curved lines. Pulling inspiration from conflicting information, we crafted anÂ identity system around the intersection of both a straight and a curved line â€”Â a mark that also neatly references the hotelâ€™s physical location, along with its mission to serve as a connecting force between guests, ideas and experiences.
