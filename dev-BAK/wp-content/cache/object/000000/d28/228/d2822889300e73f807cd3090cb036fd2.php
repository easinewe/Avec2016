The products are thoroughly vetted through a multi-tiered process involving editorial curation, scientific testing of product claims, and relevant, honest reviews from female consumers. </strong>

In designing the site, we leveraged the seasoned editorial team and 'real women' that are part of the product testing process. Looking for a means to help users find the best products to meet their specific concerns, we were able to connect them with a trusted source that they could rely on for tried and tested recommendations. As a result of the successful launch, YouBeauty, the BeautySage parent company, asked us to redesign their logo and editorial site as well.";s:10:"post_title";s:10:"BeautySage";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:10:"beautysage";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-06-06 02:12:16";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-06-06 02:12:16";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:48:"http://dev.avec.us/?post_type=project&#038;p=143";s:10:"menu_order";i:3;s:9:"post_type";s:7:"project";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
